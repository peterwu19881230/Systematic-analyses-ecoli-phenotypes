#Map the GO IDs to Nichols' strains by the .GAF file Suzi made

##read.table doesn't work for .txt files that have NA values in some rows. I have to convert the file "2017_05_ECgene_association.ecocyc.txt" into .csv and then use read.csv

##Read the file
ECgene_association.ecocyc=read.csv("Data/2017_05_ECgene_association.ecocyc.csv",stringsAsFactors=F) 
##There are newer versions. Probably doesn't differ much



##Give the column names according to the teamwiki page: https://hexamer.tamu.edu/team/wiki/index.php/Making_GAF

##map based on DB Object ID (EcoCyc symbol)
tab1=ECK_1st_table[,c("ids","EcoCycID")]
tab2=ECgene_association.ecocyc[,c("DB Object ID","GO ID")]
temp=inner_join(tab1,tab2,by=c("EcoCycID"="DB Object ID"))

names(temp)[3]="Data"
